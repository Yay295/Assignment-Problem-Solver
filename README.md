# Assignment Problem Solver

This code solves the [Assignment Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem). As far as I know, this is the fastest solver in existence. If you know of a faster one, create an issue request so I can beat it. The solver is in `APS.h`, and examples of its usage are in `Main.cpp`. There is no `APS.cpp` because the solver is entirely templated.
